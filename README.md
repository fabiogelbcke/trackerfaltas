IME's attendance policy is really freaking annoying. Go >120 points and you're out

Every unjustified abscence costs you 3 points and every justified abscence costs 1

If that wasn't enough, you can't miss more than 25% of any given class in a semester

This tracker is to help people keep track of their points and %'s so they arent desperate by the end of the semester.

It shows how many points you got, what % of classes have you missed relative to the total number of classes in the semester and how many abscenses are justified and how many are not (the 2 numbers below the %, the one on the left is justified the one on the right unjustified)
